Specify the distance in the search_radius parameter.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE—The features in the join features will be matched if they are within a specified distance of a target feature. Specify the distance in the search_radius parameter.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_GEODESIC—This is the same as WITHIN_A_DISTANCE except that geodesic distance is used rather than planar distance.  Distance between features will be calculated using a geodesic formula that takes into account the curvature of the spheroid and correctly handles data near and across the dateline and poles. Use this option if the data covers a large geographic extent or the coordinate system of the inputs is unsuitable for distance calculations.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_3D—The features in the join features will be matched if they are within a specified distance of a target feature in three-dimensional space. Specify the distance in the search_radius parameter.CONTAINS—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature contains them. The target features must be polygons or polylines. For this option, the target features cannot be points, and the join features can only be polygons when the target features are also polygons.COMPLETELY_CONTAINS—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature completely contains them. A polygon can completely contain any feature. A point cannot completely contain any feature, not even a point. A polyline can completely contain only polyline and point features.CONTAINS_CLEMENTINI—This spatial relationship produces the same results as COMPLETELY_CONTAINS except that if the join feature is entirely on the boundary of the target feature (no part is properly inside or outside) the feature will not be matched. Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.WITHIN—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature is within them. This is the opposite of CONTAINS. For this option, the target features can only be polygons when the join features are also polygons. A point can be a  join feature only if a point is the target. COMPLETELY_WITHIN—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature is completely within them. This is the opposite of COMPLETELY_CONTAINS. WITHIN_CLEMENTINI—The result will be identical to WITHIN  except if the entirety of the feature in the join features is on the boundary of the target feature, the feature will not be matched. Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.ARE_IDENTICAL_TO—The features in the join features will be matched if they are identical to a target feature. Both join and target feature must be of the same shape type—point to point, line to line, or polygon to polygon. BOUNDARY_TOUCHES—The features in the join features will be matched if they have a boundary that touches a target feature. When the target and join features are lines or polygons, the boundary of the join feature can only touch the boundary of the target feature and no part of the join feature can cross the boundary of the target feature.SHARE_A_LINE_SEGMENT_WITH—The features in the join features will be matched if they share a line segment with a target feature. The join and target features must be lines or polygons.CROSSED_BY_THE_OUTLINE_OF—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature is crossed by their outline. The join and target features must be lines or polygons. If polygons are used for the join or target features, the polygon's boundary (line) will be used. Lines that cross at a point will be matched; lines that share a line segment will not be matched.HAVE_THEIR_CENTER_IN—The features in the join features will be matched if a target feature's center falls within them. The center of the feature is calculated as follows: For polygon and multipoint, the geometry's centroid is used, and for line input, the geometry's midpoint is used. Specify the distance in the search_radius parameter.CLOSEST—The feature in the join features that is closest to a target feature will be matched. See the usage tip for more information. Specify the distance in the search_radius parameter.CLOSEST_GEODESIC—This is the same as CLOSEST except that geodesic distance is used rather than planar distance.

The selection will be processed in the enterprise geodatabase DBMS rather than on the client when all requirements are met (see usage notes).This option may provide better performance than performing the selection on the client.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within the specified distance (using Euclidean distance) of a selecting feature. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_3D—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within a specified distance of a selecting feature in three-dimensional space. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_GEODESIC—This spatial relationship is the same as the WITHIN_A_DISTANCE option except that geodesic distance is used rather than planar distance.  Distance between features will be calculated using a geodesic formula that takes into account the curvature of the spheroid and correctly handles data near and across the dateline and poles. Choose this option if the data covers a large geographic extent or the coordinate system of the inputs is unsuitable for distance calculations. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.CONTAINS—The features in the input layer will be selected if they contain a selecting feature.COMPLETELY_CONTAINS—The features in the input layer will be selected if they completely contain a selecting feature.CONTAINS_CLEMENTINI—This spatial relationship produces the same results as the CONTAINS option except that if the selecting feature is entirely on the boundary of the input feature (no part is properly inside or outside), the feature will not be selected.Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.WITHIN—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within a selecting feature.COMPLETELY_WITHIN—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are completely within or contained by a selecting feature.WITHIN_CLEMENTINI—The result will be identical to the WITHIN option result except that if the entirety of the feature in the input layer is on the boundary of the feature in the selecting layer, the feature will not be selected.Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.ARE_IDENTICAL_TO—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are identical (in geometry) to a selecting feature.BOUNDARY_TOUCHES—The features in the input layer will be selected if they have a boundary that touches a selecting feature.  When the input  features are lines or polygons, the boundary of the input feature can only touch the boundary of the selecting feature, and no part of the input feature can cross the boundary of the selecting feature.SHARE_A_LINE_SEGMENT_WITH—The features in the input layer will be selected if they share a line segment with a selecting feature. The input and selecting features must be line or polygon.CROSSED_BY_THE_OUTLINE_OF—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are crossed by the outline of a selecting feature. The input and selecting features must be lines or polygons. If polygons are used for the input or selecting layer, the polygon's boundary (line) will be used. Lines that cross at a point will be selected; lines that share a line segment will not be selected.HAVE_THEIR_CENTER_IN—The features in the input layer will be selected if their center falls within a selecting feature.

You must specify a map service in the service_file parameter.Choose this option if your organization has created a tiling scheme for an existing service on the  server and you want to match it. Matching tiling schemes ensures that the tiles will overlay correctly in your Maps SDKs application.If you choose this option, use the same coordinate system for the source map as the map with the tiling scheme you're importing.ONLINE—The ArcGIS Online/Bing Maps/Google Maps tiling scheme will be used. This is the default.The ArcGIS Online/Bing Maps/Google Maps tiling scheme allows you to overlay cache tiles with tiles from these online mapping services. ArcGIS Desktop includes this tiling scheme as a built-in option when loading a tiling scheme. When you choose this tiling scheme, the source map must use the WGS84 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) projected coordinate system.The ArcGIS Online/Bing Maps/Google Maps tiling scheme is required if you'll be overlaying the package with ArcGIS Online, Bing Maps, or Google Maps. One advantage of the ArcGIS Online/Bing Maps/Google Maps tiling scheme is that it is widely known in the web mapping world, so the tiles will match those of other organizations that have used this tiling scheme. Even if you don't plan to overlay any of these well-known map services, you may choose the tiling scheme for its interoperability potential.The ArcGIS Online/Bing Maps/Google Maps tiling scheme may contain scales that will be zoomed in too far to be of use in your map. Packaging for large scales can take up time and disk storage space. For example, the largest scale in the tiling scheme is approximately 1:1,000. Packaging the entire continental United States at this scale can take weeks and require hundreds of gigabytes of storage.

This is the default.PNG8—PNG8 format will be used. Use this format for overlay services that need to have a transparent background, such as roads and boundaries. PNG8 creates tiles of very small size on disk with no loss of information. Do not use PNG8 if the map contains more than 256 colors. Imagery, hillshades, gradient fills, transparency, and antialiasing can use more than 256 colors in a map. Even symbols such as highway shields may have subtle antialiasing around the edges that unexpectedly adds colors to a map.PNG24—PNG24 format will be used. Use this format for overlay services, such as roads and boundaries, that have more than 256 colors (if fewer than 256 colors, use PNG8). PNG32—PNG32 format will be used. Use this format for overlay services, such as roads and boundaries, that have more than 256 colors. PNG32 works well for overlay services that have antialiasing enabled on lines or text. PNG32 creates larger tiles on disk than PNG24.JPEG—JPEG format will be used. Use this format for basemap services that have large color variation and do not need a transparent background. For example, raster imagery and detailed vector basemaps work well with JPEG. JPEG is a lossy image format. It attempts to selectively remove data without affecting the appearance of the image. This can cause very small tile sizes on disk, but if a map contains vector line work or labels, it may produce too much noise or blurry areas around the lines. If this is the case, you can raise the compression value from the default of 75. A higher value, such as 90, may balance an acceptable quality of line work with the small tile size benefit of the JPEG.If you are willing to accept a minor amount of noise in the images, you may save large amounts of disk space with JPEG. The smaller tile size also means the application can download the tiles faster.MIXED—JPEG format will be used in the center of the package and PNG32 will be used on the edge of the package. Use mixed mode when you want to cleanly overlay raster packages on other layers.When a mixed package is created, PNG32 tiles are created where transparency is detected (in other words, where the map background is visible). The rest of the tiles are built using JPEG. This keeps the average file size down while providing a clean overlay on top of other packages. If you do not use the mixed mode package in this scenario, a nontransparent collar around the periphery of the image where it overlaps the other package will be visible.",

The color representing the transparent background color can be set in the application. Versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 7 do not support this type of transparency.

While the PNG32 format allows for partially transparent pixels in the range from 0 to 255, the ArcGIS Server cache generation tool only writes fully transparent (0) or fully opaque (255) values in the transparency channel. Caches using PNG32 are significantly larger than the other supported formats, so will take more disk space and require greater bandwidth to serve clients.JPEG—A lossy, three-channel image format that supports large color variations (16 million colors) but does not support transparency. Each pixel contains three 8-bit color channels. Caches using JPEG provide control over output quality and size.MIXED—Creates PNG32 anywhere that transparency is detected (in other words, anyplace where the data frame background is visible), but creates JPEG for the remaining tiles. This keeps the average file size down while providing you with a clean overlay on top of other caches.

        {
          "name": "rule_type",
          "explanation": "Specifies the topology rule that will be added.Must Not Have Gaps (Area)—There must be no voids within a single polygon or between adjacent polygons. All polygons must form a continuous surface. An error will always exist on the perimeter of the surface. You can either ignore this error or mark it as an exception. Use this rule for data that must completely cover an area. For example, soil polygons cannot include gaps or form voids; they must cover an entire area.Must Not Overlap (Area)— The interior of polygons must not overlap. The polygons can share edges or vertices. This rule is used when an area cannot belong to two or more polygons. It is useful for modeling administrative boundaries, such as ZIP Codes or voting districts, and mutually exclusive area classifications, such as land cover or landform type.Must Be Covered By Feature Class Of (Area-Area)—A polygon in one feature class (or subtype) must share all of its area with polygons in another feature class (or subtype). An area in the first feature class that is not covered by polygons from the other feature class is an error. This rule is used when an area of one type, such as a state, should be completely covered by areas of another type, such as counties.Must Cover Each Other (Area-Area)—The polygons of one feature class (or subtype) must share all of their area with the polygons of another feature class (or subtype). Polygons may share edges or vertices. Any area defined in either feature class that is not shared with the other is an error. This rule is used when two systems of classification are used for the same geographic area, and any given point defined in one system must also be defined in the other. One such case occurs with nested hierarchical datasets, such as census blocks and block groups or small watersheds and large drainage basins. The rule can also be applied to nonhierarchically related polygon feature classes, such as soil type and slope class.Must Be Covered By (Area-Area)—The polygons of one feature class (or subtype) must be contained within polygons of another feature class (or subtype). Polygons may share edges or vertices. Any area defined in the contained feature class must be covered by an area in the covering feature class. This rule is used when area features of a given type must be located within features of another type. This rule is useful when modeling areas that are subsets of a larger surrounding area, such as management units within forests or blocks within block groups.Must Not Overlap With (Area-Area)— The interior of polygons in one feature class (or subtype) must not overlap with the interior of polygons in another feature class (or subtype). Polygons of the two feature classes can share edges or vertices or be completely disjointed. This rule is used when an area cannot belong to two separate feature classes. It is useful for combining two mutually exclusive systems of area classification, such as zoning and water body type, in which areas defined within the zoning class cannot also be defined in the water body class and vice versa.Must Be Covered By Boundary Of (Line-Area)—Lines must be covered by the boundaries of area features. This is useful for modeling lines, such as lot lines, that must coincide with the edge of polygon features, such as lots.Must Be Covered By Boundary Of (Point-Area)—Points must fall on the boundaries of area features. This is useful when the point features help support the boundary system, such as boundary markers, which must be found on the edges of certain areas.Must Be Properly Inside (Point-Area)—Points must fall within area features. This is useful when the point features are related to polygons, such as wells and well pads or address points and parcels.Must Not Overlap (Line)—Lines must not overlap with lines in the same feature class (or subtype). This rule is used when line segments should not be duplicated, for example, in a stream feature class. Lines can cross or intersect but cannot share segments.Must Not Intersect (Line)—Line features from the same feature class (or subtype) must not cross or overlap each other. Lines can share endpoints. This rule is used for contour lines that should never cross each other or when the intersection of lines should only occur at endpoints, such as street segments and intersections.Must Not Have Dangles (Line)—A line feature must touch lines from the same feature class (or subtype) at both endpoints. An endpoint that is not connected to another line is called a dangle. This rule is used when line features must form closed loops, such as when they are defining the boundaries of polygon features. It can also be used when lines typically connect to other lines, as with streets. In this case, exceptions can be used when the rule is occasionally violated, as with cul-de-sac or dead-end street segments.Must Not Have Pseudo-Nodes (Line)—A line must connect to at least two other lines at each endpoint. Lines that connect to one other line (or to themselves) are considered to have pseudo nodes. This rule is used when line features must form closed loops, such as when they define the boundaries of polygons or when line features logically must connect to two other line features at each end, as with segments in a stream network, with exceptions being marked for the originating ends of first-order streams.Must Be Covered By Feature Class Of (Line-Line)— Lines from one feature class (or subtype) must be covered by the lines in another feature class (or subtype). This is useful for modeling logically different but spatially coincident lines, such as routes and streets. For example, a bus route feature class must not depart from the streets defined in the street feature class.Must Not Overlap With (Line-Line)—A line from one feature class (or subtype) must not overlap with line features in another feature class (or subtype). This rule is used when line features cannot share the same space. For example, roads must not overlap with railroads, or depression subtypes of contour lines cannot overlap with other contour lines.Must Be Covered By (Point-Line)— Points in one feature class must be covered by lines in another feature class. It does not constrain the covering portion of the line to be an endpoint. This rule is useful for points that fall along a set of lines, such as highway signs along highways.Must Be Covered By Endpoint Of (Point-Line)—Points in one feature class must be covered by the endpoints of lines in another feature class. This rule is similar to the Endpoint Must Be Covered By line rule except that, in cases where the rule is violated, it is the point feature that is marked as an error rather than the line. Boundary corner markers may be constrained to be covered by the endpoints of boundary lines.Boundary Must Be Covered By (Area-Line)— Boundaries of polygon features must be covered by lines in another feature class. This rule is used when area features must have line features that mark the boundaries of the areas. This is usually when the areas have one set of attributes and their boundaries have other attributes. For example, parcels are stored in the geodatabase along with their boundaries. Each parcel is defined by one or more line features that store information about their length or the date surveyed, and every parcel must exactly match its boundaries.Boundary Must Be Covered By Boundary Of (Area-Area)— Boundaries of polygon features in one feature class (or subtype) must be covered by boundaries of polygon features in another feature class (or subtype). This is useful when polygon features in one feature class, such as subdivisions, are composed of multiple polygons in another class, such as parcels, and the shared boundaries must be aligned.Must Not Self-Overlap (Line)—Line features must not overlap themselves. They can cross or touch but must not have coincident segments. This rule is useful for features, such as streets, in which segments might touch in a loop but the same street must not follow the same course twice.Must Not Self-Intersect (Line)—Line features must not cross or overlap themselves. This rule is useful for lines, such as contour lines, that cannot cross themselves.Must Not Intersect Or Touch Interior (Line)—A line in one feature class (or subtype) must only touch other lines of the same feature class (or subtype) at endpoints. Any line segment in which features overlap or any intersection that is not at an endpoint is an error. This rule is useful when lines must only be connected at endpoints, such as lot lines, which must split (only connect to the endpoints of) back lot lines and cannot overlap each other.Endpoint Must Be Covered By (Line-Point)—The endpoints of line features must be covered by point features in another feature class. This is useful for modeling cases in which a fitting must connect two pipes, or a street intersection must be found at the junction of two streets.Contains Point (Area-Point)—A polygon in one feature class must contain at least one point from another feature class. Points must be within the polygon, not on the boundary. This is useful when every polygon must have at least one associated point, such as when parcels must have an address point.Must Be Single Part (Line)—Lines must have only one part. This rule is useful when line features, such as highways, may not have multiple parts.Must Coincide With (Point-Point)—Points in one feature class (or subtype) must be coincident with points in another feature class (or subtype). This is useful when points must be covered by other points, such as transformers that must coincide with power poles in electric distribution networks and observation points that must coincide with stations.Must Be Disjoint (Point)—Points must be separated spatially from other points in the same feature class (or subtype). Any points that overlap are errors. This is useful for ensuring that points are not coincident or duplicated in the same feature class, such as in layers of cities, parcel lot ID points, wells, or street lamp poles.Must Not Intersect With (Line-Line)—Line features from one feature class (or subtype) must not cross or overlap lines from another feature class (or subtype). Lines can share endpoints. This rule is used when lines from two layers should never cross each other or when the intersection of lines should only occur at endpoints, such as streets and railroads.Must Not Intersect or Touch Interior With (Line-Line)—A line in one feature class (or subtype) must only touch other lines of another feature class (or subtype) at endpoints. Any line segment in which features overlap or any intersection that is not at an endpoint is an error. This rule is useful when lines from two layers must only be connected at endpoints.Must Be Inside (Line-Area)—A line must be contained within the boundary of an area feature. This is useful when lines may partially or totally coincide with area boundaries but cannot extend beyond polygons, such as state highways that must be inside state borders and rivers that must be within watersheds.Contains One Point (Area-Point)— Each polygon must contain one point feature and each point feature must fall within a single polygon. This is used when there must be a one-to-one correspondence between features of a polygon feature class and features of a point feature class, such as administrative boundaries and their capital cities. Each point must be properly inside exactly one polygon and each polygon must properly contain exactly one point. Points must be within the polygon, not on the boundary.",

This is the default. INTERSECT_3D—The features in the input layer will be selected if they intersect a selecting feature in three-dimensional space (x, y, and z).INTERSECT_DBMS—The features in the input layer will be selected if they intersect a selecting feature.This option applies to enterprise geodatabases only. The selection will be processed in the enterprise geodatabase DBMS rather than on the client when all requirements are met (see usage notes).This option may provide better performance than performing the selection on the client.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within the specified distance (using Euclidean distance) of a selecting feature. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_3D—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within a specified distance of a selecting feature in three-dimensional space. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.WITHIN_A_DISTANCE_GEODESIC—This spatial relationship is the same as the WITHIN_A_DISTANCE option except that geodesic distance is used rather than planar distance.  Distance between features will be calculated using a geodesic formula that takes into account the curvature of the spheroid and correctly handles data near and across the dateline and poles. Choose this option if the data covers a large geographic extent or the coordinate system of the inputs is unsuitable for distance calculations. Use the search_distance parameter to specify the distance.CONTAINS—The features in the input layer will be selected if they contain a selecting feature.COMPLETELY_CONTAINS—The features in the input layer will be selected if they completely contain a selecting feature.CONTAINS_CLEMENTINI—This spatial relationship produces the same results as the CONTAINS option except that if the selecting feature is entirely on the boundary of the input feature (no part is properly inside or outside), the feature will not be selected.Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.WITHIN—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are within a selecting feature.COMPLETELY_WITHIN—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are completely within or contained by a selecting feature.WITHIN_CLEMENTINI—The result will be identical to the WITHIN option result except that if the entirety of the feature in the input layer is on the boundary of the feature in the selecting layer, the feature will not be selected.Clementini defines the boundary polygon as the line separating inside and outside, the boundary of a line is defined as its end points, and the boundary of a point is always empty.ARE_IDENTICAL_TO—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are identical (in geometry) to a selecting feature.BOUNDARY_TOUCHES—The features in the input layer will be selected if they have a boundary that touches a selecting feature.  When the input  features are lines or polygons, the boundary of the input feature can only touch the boundary of the selecting feature, and no part of the input feature can cross the boundary of the selecting feature.SHARE_A_LINE_SEGMENT_WITH—The features in the input layer will be selected if they share a line segment with a selecting feature. The input and selecting features must be line or polygon.CROSSED_BY_THE_OUTLINE_OF—The features in the input layer will be selected if they are crossed by the outline of a selecting feature. The input and selecting features must be lines or polygons. If polygons are used for the input or selecting layer, the polygon's boundary (line) will be used. Lines that cross at a point will be selected; lines that share a line segment will not be selected.HAVE_THEIR_CENTER_IN—The features in the input layer will be selected if their center falls within a selecting feature.
