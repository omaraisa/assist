This value will be greater than or equal to the value specified in the Minimum cumulative percent of variance parameter below.Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—The square root of the average squared cross-validation errors. The smaller this value, the better the model fits.Percent 90 Interval (Perc90)—The percent of data points that fall within a 90 percent cross-validation confidence interval.

This value should be close to zero. A value significantly different than zero indicates that the predictions are biased.Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)—The continuous ranked probability score is a diagnostic that measures the deviation from the predictive cumulative distribution function to each observed data value.

Use this field if the measurement error values are not the same at each point.A common source of nonconstant measurement error is when the data is measured with different devices. One device might be more precise than another, which means that it will have a smaller measurement error. For example, one thermometer rounds to the nearest degree and another thermometer rounds to the nearest tenth of a degree. The variability of measurements is often provided by the manufacturer of the measuring device, or it may be known from empirical practice.Leave this parameter empty if there are no measurement error values or the measurement error values are unknown.",

Before building the regression model, the principal components of the explanatory variables are calculated, and these principal components are used as explanatory variables in the regression. Each principal component captures a certain percent of the variance of the explanatory variables, and this parameter controls the minimum percent of variance that must be captured by the principal components of each local model. For example, if a value of 75 is provided, the software will use the minimum number of principal components that are necessary to capture at least 75 percent of the variance of the explanatory variables.Principal components are all mutually uncorrelated with each other, so using principal components solves the problem of multicollinearity (explanatory variables that are correlated with each other). Most of the information contained in all explanatory variables can frequently be captured in just a few principal components. By discarding the least useful principal components, the model calculation becomes more stable and efficient without significant loss of accuracy.To calculate principal components, there must be variability in the explanatory variables, so if any of your Input explanatory variable rasters contain constant values within a subset, these constant rasters will not be used to compute principal components for that subset. If all explanatory variable rasters in a subset contain constant values, the Output diagnostic feature class will report that zero principal components were used and that they captured zero percent of the variability.",

This value can range from 0 to 1, and values close to 0 indicate that the measured value is on the far left tail of the distribution, and values close to 1 indicate that the measured value is on the right tail of the distribution.
