The available neighborhood types are NbrAnnulus, NbrCircle, NbrRectangle, NbrWedge, NbrIrregular, and NbrWeight.The following are the forms of the available neighborhood types:NbrAnnulus({innerRadius}, {outerRadius}, {units})A ring or donut-shaped neighborhood defined by an inner radius and an outer radius. The minimum value for radius is 1 cell, and the outer radius must be larger than the inner. The maximum inner radius is 2046 cells, and the maximum outer radius is 2047 cells. The default annulus is an inner radius of 1 cell and an outer radius of 3 cells.NbrCircle({radius}, {units}A circular neighborhood with the given radius. The minimum value for radius is 1 cell, and the maximum value is 2047 cells. The default radius is 3 cells.NbrRectangle({width}, {height}, {units})A rectangular neighborhood defined by width and height. The minimum value for width or height is 1 cell, and the maximum value is 4096 cells. The default is a square with a width and height of 3 cells.NbrWedge({radius}, {startAngle}, {endAngle}, {units})A wedge-shaped neighborhood defined by a radius, a start angle, and an end angle. The minimum value for radius is 1 cell, and the maximum value is 2047 cells. The wedge extends counterclockwise from the starting angle to the ending angle. Angles are specified in degrees, with 0 or 360 representing east. Negative angles can be used. The default wedge is from 0 to 90 degrees, with a radius of 3 cells.NbrIrregular(inKernelFile)A custom neighborhood with specifications set by the identified kernel text file. The minimum value for width or height of the kernel is 1 cell, and the maximum value is 4096 cells.NbrWeight(inKernelFile)A custom neighborhood with specifications set by the identified kernel text file, which can apply weights to the members of the neighborhood. The minimum value for width or height of the kernel is 1 cell, and the maximum value is 4096 cells.For the NbrAnnulus, Nbrcircle, NbrRectangle and NbrWedge neighborhoods, the distance units for the parameters can be specified in CELL units or MAP units. Cell units is the default.For kernel neighborhoods, the first line in the kernel file defines the width and height of the neighborhood in numbers of cells. The subsequent lines indicate how the input value that corresponds to that location in the kernel will be processed.

This is a pattern in which the current value equals the previous value divided by a geometric coefficient. The geometric coefficient in this classifier can change once (to its inverse) to optimize the class ranges.

If the input training sample data is a feature class layer, such as a building layer or a standard classification training sample file, use the KITTI Labels or PASCAL Visual Object Classes option (KITTI_rectangles or PASCAL_VOC_rectangles in Python). The output metadata is a .txt file or an .xml file containing the training sample data contained in the minimum bounding rectangle. The name of the metadata file matches the input source image name. If the input training sample data is a class map, use the Classified Tiles option (Classified_Tiles in Python) as the output metadata format.KITTI_rectangles—The metadata will follow the same format as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) Object Detection Evaluation dataset. The KITTI dataset is a vision benchmark suite. The label files are plain text files. All values, both numerical and strings, are separated by spaces, and each row corresponds to one object.This format is used for object detection.PASCAL_VOC_rectangles—The metadata will follow the same format as the Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modeling and Computational Learning, Visual Object Classes (PASCAL_VOC) dataset. The PASCAL VOC dataset is a standardized image dataset for object class recognition. The label files are in XML format and contain information about image name, class value, and bounding boxes. This format is used for object detection. This is the default.Classified_Tiles—The output will be one classified image chip per input image chip. No other metadata for each image chip is used. Only the statistics output has more information about the classes, such as class names, class values, and output statistics. This format is primarily used\r\nfor pixel classification. This format is also used for change\r\ndetection when the output is one classified image chip from two image\r\nchips.RCNN_Masks—The output will be image chips that have a mask on the areas where the sample exists. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. This format is based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone in the deep learning framework model. This format is used for object detection, but it can also be used for  object tracking when the Siam Mask model type is used during training, as well as time series pixel classification when the PSETAE architecture is used.Labeled_Tiles—Each output tile will be labeled with a specific class. This format is used for object classification.MultiLabeled_Tiles—Each output tile will be labeled with one or more classes. For example, a tile may be labeled agriculture and also cloudy. This format is used for object classification.Export_Tiles—The output will be image chips with no label. This format is used\r\nfor image translation techniques, such as Pix2Pix and Super\r\nResolution.CycleGAN—The output will be image chips with no label. This format is used\r\nfor image translation technique CycleGAN, which is used to train\r\nimages that do not overlap.Imagenet—Each output tile will be labeled with a specific class. This format is used for object classification, but it can also be used for  object tracking when the Deep Sort model type is used during training.Panoptic_Segmentation—The output will be one classified image chip\r\nand one instance per input image chip. The output will also have image chips\r\nthat mask the areas where the sample exists; these image chips will be\r\nstored in a different folder.This format is used for both pixel\r\nclassification and instance segmentation, so two output labels\r\nfolders will be produced.\r\nFor the KITTI metadata format, 15 columns are created, but only 5 of them are used in the tool. The first column is the class value. The next 3 columns are skipped. Columns 5 through 8 define the minimum bounding rectangle, which is composed of four image coordinate locations: left, top, right, and bottom pixels. The minimum bounding rectangle encompasses the training chip used in the deep learning classifier. The remaining columns are not used.\r\nThe following is an example of the PASCAL_VOC_rectangles option:  &lt;?xml version=”1.0”?&gt;\n- &lt;layout&gt;\n      &lt;image&gt;000000000&lt;/image&gt;\n      &lt;object&gt;1&lt;/object&gt;\n    - &lt;part&gt;\n         &lt;class&gt;1&lt;/class&gt;\n       - &lt;bndbox&gt;\n            &lt;xmin&gt;31.85&lt;/xmin&gt;\n            &lt;ymin&gt;101.52&lt;/ymin&gt;\n            &lt;xmax&gt;256.00&lt;/xmax&gt;\n            &lt;ymax&gt;256.00&lt;/ymax&gt;\n         &lt;/bndbox&gt;\n      &lt;/part&gt;\n  &lt;/layout&gt;For more information, see the Microsoft PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge paper.",
