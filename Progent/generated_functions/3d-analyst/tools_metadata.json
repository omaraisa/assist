The value can be integer or floating point. The default value is -90 (straight down).This parameter value must be less than the Vertical upper angle parameter value.You can select a field in the input observers dataset, or you can specify a numerical value.By default, a numerical field VERT2 is used if it exists in the input observer features attribute table. You may overwrite it by specifying another numerical field or a value.If this parameter is unspecified and the default field does not exist in the input observer features attribute table, it defaults to -90.",
