The value of  each cell that contains points is determined by the points within the cell, whereas the value of cells without points can either be interpolated or assigned as NoData. The following options are available for the binning type:Cell Assignment—The technique that will be used for assigning values to cells which contain points.Average—Assigns the average value of all points in the cell. This is the default.Minimum—Assigns the minimum value found in the points within the\r\ncell.Maximum—Assigns the maximum value found in the points within the\r\ncell.IDW—Uses Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation to determine the\r\ncell value.Nearest—Uses Nearest Neighbor assignment to determine the cell\r\nvalue.Void Fill Method—The technique that will be used for assigning values to cells that do not contain points.None—NoData is assigned to the cells that do not contain points.Simple—Assigns values to cells without points by averaging the  values from the cells that immediately surround them. This technique eliminates small voids.Linear—Constructs a triangulated surface across void areas and uses linear interpolation on the TIN to determine the empty cell's value. This technique will cover very large voids in the data and is the default.Natural Neighbor—Uses natural neighbor interpolation to determine the\r\nvalue of cells with no points. It is recommended that the LAS dataset has a clip polygon surface constraint when using this technique.When Interpolation Type is set to Triangulation,  cell values are derived by constructing in-memory TIN surfaces from the LAS dataset's points and surface constraints. The in-memory TINs are used to   interpolate cell values for the output raster. The following options are available for the triangulation type:Interpolation MethodLinear—Uses linear interpolation to determine cell values.Natural Neighbors—Uses natural neighbor interpolation to determine cell value.Thinning TypeNo Thinning—The LAS dataset points will not be thinned when constructing the intermediate TIN surfaces.Window Size—The LAS dataset points will be thinned by dividing the data extent into square bins and selecting a point within each bin. The size of the bin that will be used to subdivide the data area will be determined by the value provided for the Resolution parameter, and the point that is selected will be based on the option specified for the Selection Method parameter.\tSelection MethodMaximum—The point with the highest value in each window size is maintained. This is the default.Minimum—The point with the lowest value in each window size is maintained.Closest To Mean—The point whose value is closest to the average of all point values in the window size is maintained.When the point thinning type is set to Window Size,  the points are subsampled before interpolating the output raster by dividing the data into square grids. The size of the grids are based on the value provided for the resolution. The unit of the value will be based on the linear unit of the LAS dataset's horizontal coordinate system.The Resolution value is the length of each side of the two-dimensional grid that will be used to subdivide the data when the point thinning type is set to Window Size.

These settings are as follows:Spatial coordinates in x,y format—Allows two sequential numbers such as 630084 4833438 or 981075.652ftUS 607151.272ftUS to be recognized as coordinates when they are valid for a planar coordinate system associated with the input documents. You can specify whether numbers with and without units are recognized or  only numbers with units of measure are recognized as coordinates.Custom coordinate and date formats—Allows you to customize how text is recognized as a spatial coordinate or a date, particularly when written in a language other than English or using a format that is not common in the United States. For example, a spatial coordinate written as 30 20 10 N x 060 50 40 W can be recognized with a customization to recognize  the character x as valid text between the latitude and longitude. Coordinates and dates such as 60.91°N, 147.34°O and 17 juillet, 2018 can be recognized when customizations are specified to accommodate the language of the documents, in this case French. Also, when two-digit years are used, you can control the range of years to which they are matched.Preferences for some ambiguous dates—Dates such as 10/12/2019 are ambiguous because they can be interpreted as either October 12, 2019, or December 10, 2019. Some countries use the m/d/yy date format as a standard, and other countries use the d/m/yy format. A preference can be set for how these ambiguous dates are interpreted, either as m/d/yy or d/m/yy, to suit the country of origin of the documents.Length of fields in the output feature class—You can specify the length of the fields containing text surrounding spatial coordinates that are extracted from a document using the Pre-Text Field Length (pre_text_length in Python) and Post-Text Field Length (post_text_length in Python) parameters. The Extract Locations pane allows you to control the length of several additional fields in the attribute table, including fields  containing dates extracted from the document, the original text that was converted to dates, the file name from which the information was extracted, and so on.",

These settings are as follows:Spatial coordinates in x,y format—Allows two sequential numbers such as 630084 4833438 or 981075.652ftUS 607151.272ftUS to be recognized as coordinates when they are valid for a planar coordinate system associated with the input documents. You can specify whether numbers with and without units are recognized or  only numbers with units of measure are recognized as coordinates.Custom coordinate and date formats—Allows you to customize how text is recognized as a spatial coordinate or a date, particularly when written in a language other than English or using a format that is not common in the United States. For example, a spatial coordinate written as 30 20 10 N x 060 50 40 W can be recognized with a customization to recognize  the character x as valid text between the latitude and longitude. Coordinates and dates such as 60.91°N, 147.34°O and 17 juillet, 2018 can be recognized when customizations are specified to accommodate the language of the documents, in this case French. Also, when two-digit years are used, you can control the range of years to which they are matched.Preferences for some ambiguous dates—Dates such as 10/12/2019 are ambiguous because they can be interpreted as either October 12, 2019, or December 10, 2019. Some countries use the m/d/yy date format as a standard, and other countries use the d/m/yy format. A preference can be set for how these ambiguous dates are interpreted, either as m/d/yy or d/m/yy, to suit the country of origin of the documents.Length of fields in the output feature class—You can specify the length of the fields containing text surrounding spatial coordinates that are extracted from a document using the Pre-Text Field Length (pre_text_length in Python) and Post-Text Field Length (post_text_length in Python) parameters. The Extract Locations pane allows you to control the length of several additional fields in the attribute table, including fields  containing dates extracted from the document, the original text that was converted to dates, the file name from which the information was extracted, and so on.",
